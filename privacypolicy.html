          A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your
          computerâ€™s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the
          cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a
          particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as
          an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your

          about your preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used.
          This helps us analyse data about webpage traffic and improve our
          website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this
          information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is
          removed from the system.

          Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website by enabling
          us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A
          cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information
          about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
